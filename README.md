Rails engine to generate instant reports from adhoc SQL query.

![adhoq](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3419/4556639/7f06340a-4ecb-11e4-87c4-b074580e77f5.png)

## Features

- Export ad-hoc SQL reports in some formats:
  - .csv
  - .json
  - .xlsx
- Persist generated report as local file or in AWS S3
- over Rails 5.1.X
- Nice administration console with rails engine

### Future planning

- [ ] Label data substitution

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'adhoq'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install adhoq

## Usage

### As Rails engine

Install migrations

```sh
$ bundle exec rake adhoq:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Mount it in `config/routes.rb`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root  to: 'hi#show'

  mount Adhoq::Engine => "/adhoq"
end
```

Edit initialization file in `config/initializers/adhoq.rb`

```ruby
Adhoq.configure do |config|
  # if not set, use :on_the_fly.(default)
  config.storage       = [:local_file, Rails.root + './path/to/store/report/files']
  config.authorization = ->(controller) { controller.signed_in? }
  config.report_file_name_prefix = 'b2b_report_'
end
```

See configuration example in [dummy app](https://github.com/esminc/adhoq/blob/master/spec/dummy/config/initializers/adhoq.rb).

Then restart server and try it out.

### As Plain old library (application export helper)

Adhoq also provides report generation from SQL string, not from mounted rails engine.

```ruby
execution = Adhoq::AdhocExecution.new(
  'xlsx',
  'SELECT "hello" AS name ,"English greeting message" AS description'
)

Adhoq::Reporter.generate(execution) #=> report data
```

Persistence is also available without engine via `Adhoq::Storage::SomeClass#store`.
Below is example that generating report and persist to in Rails application report method.

```ruby
execution = Adhoq::AdhocExecution.new(
  'xlsx',
  'SELECT "hello" AS name ,"English greeting message" AS description'
)

storage   = Storage::S3.new(
  'my-adhoq-bucket',
  aws_access_key_id: 'key_id',
  aws_secret_access_key: 'access_key',
  expires_in: 1.day
)

# or

storage   = Storage::Google.new(
  'my-adhoq-bucket',
  google_storage_access_key_id: 'key_id',
  google_storage_secret_access_key: 'access_key',
  expires_in: 1.day
)

# generate report and store it to S3, returns `key` to get report data
key = storage.store('.xlsx') { Adhoq::Reporter.generate(execution) }

...
storage.get(key) #=> report data
```
